perform all of the required computations. The computations included find out the value of maximum, minimum, median, mean, variance and standard deviation, display
the distinct numbers and its frequency, plot a histogram in textual form, display the data items above and below the mean, compute the Pearsonâ€™s correlation, compute the
linear regression as well as display data either in ascending or descending order. The menu interface is user-friendly, users can easily understand it and get the computation
